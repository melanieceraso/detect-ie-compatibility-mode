jQuery to detect if IE is in Compatibility Mode

Ran into the need to detect whether or not IE was in Compatibility Mode or not a few weeks ago.  Wanted to share the code that I came up with since there seemed to some incomplete references out there.  With browser detection being deprecated with JQuery 1.8, I added a patch to bridge the gap.

This script will return a boolean value anytime the Document Mode for IE is “IE7 standards.”
